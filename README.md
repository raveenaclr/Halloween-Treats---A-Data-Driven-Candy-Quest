### What is the objective?
The objective of this project is to explore the given Halloween candy dataset to uncover the insights to identify what makes certain candies more popular among the people.

### How I presented meaningful insights?
The dashboard is divided into three sections:
#### 1. Trick or Treat Champions: 
This section focuses on the top 3 candies by win%, top 3 expensive chocolates, and top 3 low-sugar candies.
#### 2. Candy Secrets Unwrapped:
Here I 've categorized the candies into 4 groups based on their healthiness an d price with a table displaying the top 15 candies in each group. This helps to visualize the balance between indulgence and health.
3. Sweet Stats and Spooky Insights:
This section delivers statistical insights through scatterplots and radar charts, such as whether high-sugar candies are more popular and which features dominate popular candies. These insights help uncover patterns in candy success factors, like pluribus, fruity flavors, and chocolate
